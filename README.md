# Udacity Memory Game Project 2 - Front End Web Development 

This Project is part of Udacity's Front End Web Development "Nanodegree" course.
* The project had us create a classic memory game.  The task was to code the game either from scratch or with some html (a skeleton) already provided to structure the deck of cards (16 cards of 2 pairs.)  I used the skeleton as a guideline in order to complete this project. 

## Memory Game Logic
* The game randomly shuffles the cards. A user wins once all cards have successfully been matched.

## Features
* Once all the cards have been matched, a Congratulations Pop-Up appears and you can click the restart button to start the game over again.  A timer begins once you have started the game.
